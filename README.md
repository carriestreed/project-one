Click <a href="http://www.carriestreed.com/project-one/"> HERE </a> for a demo.

###Technologies Used
JavaScript, HTML, HTML5 (canvas), CSS

###Install
Game must be run on a server

###Unsolved Problems
There are design aspects that I'd like to implement for better user experience:
  * Fix bug where players get stuck on the wall during the race
  * Add finish lines to make it more obvious to the players where they should be exiting
  * Make the game dynamic
  * Create additional levels
  * Require Sign-in
