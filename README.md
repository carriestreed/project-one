THE MAZE RACE


###Technologies Used
JavaScript, HTML, HTML5 (canvas), CSS

###The Approach
The first goal was to get a working game. My first pass wasn't pretty, many of my functions were repeating over and over to achieve 2-player functionality--so the next goal was to condense the code as much as I could. By using object methods in app-canvas.js, I've been able to cut down my code by almost half.

###Install
Game must be run on a server

###Unsolved Problems
There are design aspects that I'd like to implement for better user experience:
  * Fix bug where players get stuck on the wall during the race
  * Add finish lines to make it more obvious to the players where they should be exiting
  * Make the game dynamic
  * Create additional levels

Also, although I was able to dry out app-canvas.js, I know I could condense it even more. Plus, the same still needs to be done with app.js.
